                  During the 2020-2021 academic year, Shree also took two
                  400-level courses in Combinatorics with me. In both courses
                  Shree earned a final grade of 95% (class averages of 87% and
                  82%). Shreeâ€™s performance is especially impressive considering
                  that he took the prerequisite course for Combinatorics 1
                  simultaneously, rather than before the course. Still, he
                  demonstrated persistence, attention to detail, and proficiency
                  with concepts throughout the course, outperforming many
                  students who had taken the prerequisite course in a previous
                  semester. In addition to his excellence in academics, Shree is
                  highly engaged with extracurricular work. He has served as
                  president of the Valparaiso International Students
                  Association, vice president of the Association for Computing
                  Machinery, worked in the university admissions office, and
                  served in Student Senate. His resume tells an even deeper
                  story of both on and off-campus experience. He approaches each
                  of these activities with thoughtfulness for how he can
                  contribute as a leader in ways that benefit others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In summary, I have no doubt that you will enjoy working with
                  Shree as much as I have. He is detail- oriented, persistent,
                  hard-working, analytical, and mature. His intuition and
                  curiosity are strong. I recommend him to you highly and
                  without reservation.

                  I have known Shreedhar since he was an applicant to Valparaiso
                  University. When he was the President of the International
                  Student Club, I was an advisor and worked with him in
                  admission. I have always been impressed by how he is so strong
                  at building relationships with outside organizations, faculty,
                  and students worldwide. He is also very well-spoken and has
                  even been featured in videos and participated in a Ted talk.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He is very hardworking and takes advantage of every
                  opportunity presented to him and develops. Anyone would be
                  lucky to hire this innovative thinker and someone who works as
                  hard as Shreedhar.

                  Shree did some awesome work on the Software End of things at
                  Woven. It was a joy seeing him provide updates and feedback on
                  the tech side to the rest of the company in a way we could all
                  understand it regardless of our software background.

                <p>
                  Shree brought amazing energy to all of our meetings and he was
                  a pleasure to work with.
