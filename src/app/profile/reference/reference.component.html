                  During the 2020-2021 academic year, Shree also took two
                  400-level courses in Combinatorics with me. In both courses
                  Shree earned a final grade of 95% (class averages of 87% and
                  82%). Shree’s performance is especially impressive considering
                  that he took the prerequisite course for Combinatorics 1
                  simultaneously, rather than before the course. Still, he
                  demonstrated persistence, attention to detail, and proficiency
                  with concepts throughout the course, outperforming many
                  students who had taken the prerequisite course in a previous
                  semester. In addition to his excellence in academics, Shree is
                  highly engaged with extracurricular work. He has served as
                  president of the Valparaiso International Students
                  Association, vice president of the Association for Computing
                  Machinery, worked in the university admissions office, and
                  served in Student Senate. His resume tells an even deeper
                  story of both on and off-campus experience. He approaches each
                  of these activities with thoughtfulness for how he can
                  contribute as a leader in ways that benefit others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In summary, I have no doubt that you will enjoy working with
                  Shree as much as I have. He is detail- oriented, persistent,
                  hard-working, analytical, and mature. His intuition and
                  curiosity are strong. I recommend him to you highly and
                  without reservation.

                  I have known Shreedhar since he was an applicant to Valparaiso
                  University. When he was the President of the International
                  Student Club, I was an advisor and worked with him in
                  admission. I have always been impressed by how he is so strong
                  at building relationships with outside organizations, faculty,
                  and students worldwide. He is also very well-spoken and has
                  even been featured in videos and participated in a Ted talk.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He is very hardworking and takes advantage of every
                  opportunity presented to him and develops. Anyone would be
                  lucky to hire this innovative thinker and someone who works as
                  hard as Shreedhar.

                  Shree did some awesome work on the Software End of things at
                  Woven. It was a joy seeing him provide updates and feedback on
                  the tech side to the rest of the company in a way we could all
                  understand it regardless of our software background.

                <p>
                  Shree brought amazing energy to all of our meetings and he was
                  a pleasure to work with.

                  One thing that has always stuck out to me about Shree is his
                  ability to make himself become, and then stay, comfortable in
                  any situation or environment. When he was having difficulty
                  finding his way, he was not afraid to make me aware and share
                  his concerns. Shree stepped out of his comfort zone coming to
                  the United States for college alone. In our office, Shree was
                  expected to communicate and find commonalities with, almost
                  exclusively, high school students from the U.S. who had
                  totally different experiences than him. Shree came to me one
                  time to discuss struggles while making phone calls to
                  students. He took kindly to advice and encouragement, found a
                  way to be effective in his work while still meeting
                  expectations, and succeeded in his role. Shree’s work ethic is
                  one of his best qualities.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Shree always represented Valparaiso University positively, and
                  was looked up to by his teammates, because of his calm
                  demeanor, his ability to adapt to each and every family, and
                  his wide range of experience as a student and in our office. I
                  believe Shree’s experience in our office has prepared him well
                  to be successful in any team environment.
