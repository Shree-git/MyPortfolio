In both courses Shree earned a final grade of 95% (class averages of 87% and 82%). Shree’s performance is especially impressive considering that he took the prerequisite course for Combinatorics 1 simultaneously, rather than before the course. Still, he demonstrated persistence, attention to detail, and proficiency with concepts throughout the course, outperforming many students who had taken the prerequisite course in a previous semester. In addition to his excellence in academics, Shree is highly engaged with extracurricular work. He has served as president of the Valparaiso International Students Association, vice president of the Association for Computing Machinery, worked in the university admissions office, and served in Student Senate. His resume tells an even deeper story of both on and off-campus experience. He approaches each of these activities with thoughtfulness for how he can contribute as a leader in ways that benefit others.", "In summary, I have no doubt that you will enjoy working with Shree as much as I have. He is detail- oriented, persistent, hard-working, analytical, and mature. His intuition and curiosity are strong. I recommend him to you highly and without reservation."]

He is also very well-spoken and has even been featured in videos and participated in a Ted talk.", "He is very hardworking and takes advantage of every opportunity presented to him and develops. Anyone would be lucky to hire this innovative thinker and someone who works as hard as Shreedhar."]

        "desc": ["Let’s start with the basics – in the classroom, Shree was one of the top academic performers of his class, both in my own class and in others. He received a major in both computer science and mathematics. In my class (PDEs), his work was always neat, meticulous, and correct. Each professor learns which students in a class produce work which can be a pseudo-solution-key … that is, work in which, if there’s a discrepancy between your own solutions and his, you’d better double check to be sure your own is correct. Shree was one such student. But lots of people do very well in classes, so what else is there? I also got to watch Shree struggle, and ultimately succeed, with handling a very difficult situation in trying to arrange a semester abroad for study at Cambridge. He had to learn way more than any undergraduate should ever need to about bureaucracy, and how to fight his way through it. Because of his visa status, he had to juggle (sometimes contradictory) information from the US government visa offices and our own Department of International Programs to ultimately secure a visa which would allow him to change locations from the US to Great Britain for a semester of study, all while the clock was ticking on the start date for the semester in Cambridge, and while the semester at Valpo had already started – meaning, if his plans to attend Cambdige fell through, he would be behind at VU. It was an extremely frustrating and uncertain experience for him, but he stuck with it and got it all done just in time. I’m sure he will have some stories to tell about this experience.", "Overall, I have every confidence Shree has developed into a young professional with significant potential to succeed in technical and computer related work. He will make an excellent addition to your teams, and I imagine he will perform above expectations. I heartily recommend Shree Pandey for any position he is eligible for."]

When he was having difficulty finding his way, he was not afraid to make me aware and share his concerns. Shree stepped out of his comfort zone coming to the United States for college alone. In our office, Shree was expected to communicate and find commonalities with, almost exclusively, high school students from the U.S. who had totally different experiences than him. Shree came to me one time to discuss struggles while making phone calls to students. He took kindly to advice and encouragement, found a way to be effective in his work while still meeting expectations, and succeeded in his role. Shree’s work ethic is one of his best qualities.", "Shree always represented Valparaiso University positively, and was looked up to by his teammates, because of his calm demeanor, his ability to adapt to each and every family, and his wide range of experience as a student and in our office. I believe Shree’s experience in our office has prepared him well to be successful in any team environment."]
